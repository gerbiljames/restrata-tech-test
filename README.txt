This is a project for a simple app that reads the ID of a an NFC card using the phone NFC reader. 
You should be able to use most of the credit cards or your Oyster card without having to change the code to configure the reader.

The code is not good.
How would you improve it?

Can you implement the following additional features? 
1) Store in a database the ID that the app reads with the timestamp, You can use any database you want.
2) Show the ID with a different color if it is not the first time you tap it in.
3) Optional: show in another screen all the IDs and timestamps

The app is using Jetpack Compose and flows. 
If you are not confortable with these technologies yet, you can reuse the code in another project using a layout based UI and any other concurrency technology you prefer (coroutines, RxJava etc).
The purpouse of the exercise is to see how you structure the code.
